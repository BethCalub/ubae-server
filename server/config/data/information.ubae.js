I believe in the values of philosophy that in the realm of the mind and spirit lies the road to unity and peace. I believe in democracy, in the ultimate capacity of the common man to think his problems through. I believe in science, in its conquest over the elements and its tremendous possibilities for the future. I believe in the arts, in their power to free men from the enslavement of ignorance. I believe in the profound value of religion that basically all human problems are moral problems. I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, in His redeeming sacrifice and in His dynamic and vital conception of life. I believe in the credo cut boldly and enduringly into stone above portals of my Alma Mater, University of Baguio. Our Native Land, The Master of Science. The Contemplation of the Beautiful.',
